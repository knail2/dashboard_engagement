Here's a summary of several multi-agent frameworks for agentic LLM-based workflows, including LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AgentLite:

### LangGraph
LangGraph is a framework designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications using large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the use of graphs to define complex interactions between agents. Key features include:

- **Stateful Multi-Actor Applications**: Supports applications involving multiple interacting agents with maintained states throughout the process.
- **Cyclical Computation Support**: Allows for cycles within LLM applications, which is crucial for simulating agent-like behaviors.
- **Integration with LangChain**: Builds on LangChain to extend its capabilities, especially useful for applications requiring repetitive or cyclical processes.

LangGraph is particularly suitable for custom-built systems needing detailed control and scalability【6†source】【7†source】.

### CrewAI
CrewAI focuses on role-based agent design, enabling agents to assume specific roles and goals, thus facilitating sophisticated multi-agent interactions. Notable features include:

- **Role-Based Agent Design**: Customizable agents with predefined roles and goals, supported by specific toolsets.
- **Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation**: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks among themselves to enhance problem-solving efficiency.
- **Flexible Task Management**: Supports dynamic assignment of tasks to agents, adapting to project needs.

CrewAI is ideal for scenarios requiring structured processes and high flexibility, making it suitable for both development and production environments【7†source】【10†source】.

### AutoGen
AutoGen is an open-source framework by Microsoft designed for creating LLM applications via multiple conversational agents. Its main characteristics are:

- **Conversational Engagement**: Agents can engage in dialogues, sharing messages to accomplish tasks collectively.
- **Customization and Integration**: Allows integration of various components like LLMs, human inputs, and tools, offering a high degree of customization.
- **Teachable Agents**: Agents can learn from interactions and improve their performance over time.

AutoGen excels in creating conversational patterns and is highly autonomous, making it suitable for complex and diverse applications【8†source】【9†source】.

### AgentLite
AgentLite is a lightweight library developed by Salesforce AI Research for building and advancing task-oriented LLM-based agent systems. It simplifies the creation and orchestration of both individual and multi-agent systems, providing an easy-to-use foundation for research and development.

Key Features
- Lightweight Codebase: Designed for easy implementation of new agent/multi-agent architectures.
- Task-Oriented Agents: Focus on specific tasks, enhancing performance and capabilities.
- Research-Oriented: Ideal for exploring advanced concepts in multi-agent systems.
