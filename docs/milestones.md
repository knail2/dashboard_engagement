## Implementation steps and milestones

Excellent! With the API methods confirmed, we'll now move on to outlining the **Implementation** steps and the **Milestones** to track the progress of this project.

### Implementation

To implement the API specification designed for interfacing with the Tableau platform, we will follow these steps:

1. **API Development Environment Setup**
   - Setup MuleSoft as the primary API development environment.
   - Configure development, testing, and production environments.
   - Establish secure connectivity to Tableau and Snowflake databases.

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure API access.
   - Set up client credentials flow for consuming applications.

3. **API Endpoints Development**
   - Develop each API endpoint as specified, starting with "Must Have" endpoints.
   - Integrate API with Tableau to fetch real-time and historical usage data.
   - Implement logic for data aggregation and transformation where necessary.

4. **Persistent Storage Setup**
   - Set up schemas and tables in Snowflake to store user details, session logs, and other metadata for historical and real-time data.
   - Implement data extraction, transformation, and loading processes (ETL) for necessary data flows between Tableau and Snowflake.

5. **Testing**
   - Perform unit testing for each endpoint to ensure they meet functional requirements.
   - Conduct integration testing to validate data flows and integrations with Tableau and Snowflake.
   - Execute load testing to ensure scalability and performance benchmarks are met.

6. **Documentation and Swagger API Spec**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation including Swagger or OpenAPI specifications for easy integration by client applications.
   - Document all endpoints, expected responses, and error handling procedures.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploy the API to a production environment.
   - Set up monitoring tools to track API usage, performance, and error rates.
   - Implement logging for deeper insights and diagnostics.
